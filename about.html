					<div class="abouttext">
						<p>I was born in London, England and grew up in the rain with my yellow lab, Cognac, as a companion. We played in gardens that smelled like thyme and kept snails as pets and watched the foxes come and go from the den behind our house.</p>
						<p>Then we moved all the way to Texas, where I fostered a love of horses and big fields to gallop in and Mexican food. My father being a geologist from New Mexico, I also grew to love the desert, Native American culture, mountains, and Hatch green chile.</p>
						<p>Then, again, we moved across the globe to Brisbane, Australia, where I am currently based. Over the ten years that I have lived in this place, I&#39;ve fallen in love with the creativity of its people, its glorious weather, its flora and fauna, its cafes and restaurants, and importantly, photography. I studied social documentary and photojournalism for four years at the Queensland College of Art and emerged with a Bachelor of Photography with Honours in 2011.</p>
						<p>In my personal work I photograph my own struggles, loves, happinesses, heartbreaks, and losses in order to better understand myself and others. I work alongside a notion centred on the acceptance of transience and imperfection. Nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect.</p>
						<p>Because of my intrinsic nature as a documentist, I love making images for other people in an organic, natural way. Whether you are a bride and groom, an interior designer, or a small business, I would love to make images that reflect the way you do things. Naturally, beautifully, and imperfectly.</p>
